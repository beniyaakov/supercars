        1959—1968: Beginnings Datsun SP310 (1962) Mazda Cosmo (1968) The first
        Japanese sports car was the 1959-1960 Datsun 211, a two-seat roadster
        built on the chassis of a compact pickup truck and powered by a 1.0 L
        (60 cu in) engine. Only 20 cars were built, and the 1963-1965 Datsun
        SP310— based on the chassis of a passenger sedan instead of a pickup
        truck— is often considered Datsun's first mass-production sports car.
        Honda's first sports car was the 1963-1964 Honda S500, a two-seat
        roadster with independent suspension for all wheels and a 0.5 L (32 cu
        in) DOHC engine. In 1965, Toyota joined the two-seat roadster market
        with the Toyota Sports 800. Mazda is noted for its use of rotary
        engines, beginning in 1967 with the Mazda Cosmo. The Cosmo was a
        two-seat coupe with a 0.9 L (55 cu in) rotary engine producing up to 97
        kW (130 bhp). Mazda continued to produce sports cars with rotary engines
        (sometimes turbocharged) until the Mazda RX-8 ended production in 2012.
        The Toyota 2000GT, produced from 1967 to 1970, was an expensive two-seat
        coupe that greatly changed overseas perceptions of the Japanese
        automotive industry. The 2000GT demonstrated that Japan was capable of
        producing high-end sports cars to rival the traditional European brands.

        1980-1999: Turbocharging and all-wheel drive emerge Renault Fuego Turbo
        (1984) McLaren F1 (1993-1998) Porsche Boxster (986) (1996-2004)
        Turbocharging became increasingly popular in the 1980s, from relatively
        affordable coupes such as the 1980-1986 Renault Fuego and 1992-1996
        Rover 220 Coupé Turbo, to expensive supercars such as the 1984-1987
        Ferrari 288 GTO and 1987-1992 Ferrari F40. In the late 1980s and early
        1990s, several manufacturers developed supercars which competed for
        production car top speed records. These cars included the 1986-1993
        Porsche 959, 1991-1995 Bugatti EB 110, 1992-1994 Jaguar XJ220 and
        1993-1998 McLaren F1. The 1980-1995 Audi Quattro was a pioneering
        all-wheel drive sports car. The 1995 Porsche 911 Turbo (993) say the 911
        Turbo model switch to all-wheel drive, a drivetrain layout that the
        model uses to this day. The BMW M3 was released in 1986 and has been
        produced for every generation since. The 1993-1996 Mercedes-Benz W124
        E36 AMG was the mass-produced AMG model.[81] Audi's equivalent division,
        called "RS", was launched in 1994 with the Audi RS 2 Avant. Ford Europe
        withdrew from the sports car market at the end of 1986 when the Capri
        was discontinued after a production run of nearly two decades. There was
        no direct successor, as Ford was concentrating on higher performance
        versions of its hatchback and saloon models at the time. In 1989, a new
        generation of Lotus Elan roadster was released which used a front-wheel
        drive layout, a controversial choice for a "purist" sports car. The Elan
        sold poorly and is was discontinued after three years. The 1996 Lotus
        Elise, a mid-engined, rear-wheel drive roadster, was much more
        successful and remains in production to this day. Roadsters enjoyed a
        resurgence in the mid 1990s, including the 1989-present Mazda MX-5, the
        1995-2002 BMW Z3 (succeeded by the 2002-2016 BMW Z4), the 1995-2002 MG
        F, the 1996-present Porsche Boxster and the 1998-present Audi TT.
